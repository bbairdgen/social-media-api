  ## Description
  
  This project is an example of how I built a NoSQL social media API. I built this to practice creating APIs and work with a NoSQL database. I learned a lot about how to connect the different models and even populate the models. I also learned how to use DateJS to convert the dates to a more readable format.

  ## Credits
  
  I was able to create this project by reviewing code and instructions from my boot camp modules. I also received help from my instructor, TAs, and a tutor, Julio Valdez. I also reviewed the documentation for DateJS. When I got stuck in a couple of portions, I was able to find answers in forums like StackOverflow.
